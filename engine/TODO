----- highet priority --------

-- additional abstract layer separating implemenation from interface on nodes -> (like on hub)
-- make working unit tests!
-- modify ColumnStorage in the similar way as IColumn -> ColumnImpl is done and managed from Fatory
-- External logger!



-- kickof implementations from headers
-- fix the issue with file paths
-- fix ctests
-- error Handling
-- making CMake configuration and modules clean and as it should be

-- make the function generating function names to bind on nodes
-- make the separate 'utility' module and move there all the helper funcions like
this above and prints etc.

- Column class
- Column Keeper
- Filling (from x to y values)
- Dockerization
- Refactorization (make clang-tidy silent)
- Handle unit testing
